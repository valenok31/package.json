# What is that?

This is a training project "social network", created according to the training course ["React JS - the way of the samurai 1.0"](https://www.youtube.com/c/ITKAMASUTRA).
The social network was created by me while studying React JS. The basics of ReactJS were worked out in the project: state, storage, component, dispatch, props, redux, etc.
